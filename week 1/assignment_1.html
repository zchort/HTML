    <h2>Bradley Graves</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Bradley Graves and I am from Queen Creek, Arizona and I have lived there my whole life until I just recently moved to Rexburg for my first semester at BYUI and I'm excited to be learning with you all. I am a middle child from a blended family, with my sister also attending BYUI, and 3 younger siblings living at home. I have a few hobbies such as reading and studying various topics like psychology, philosophy, religion, SciFi, and mysteries; as well as playing video games, playing guitar, ping pong, and swimming. I love music as well and almost minored in it, but decided to major in Computer Science and minor in Mandarin Chinese. There are numerous advantages to taking a web design class, mostly in understanding how the technology we use in our every day lives works. Not only this, but careers in programming and web design are extremely versatile and generally well-paying, and as someone who takes great interest and performs well in mathematics and semantics I think it is something I can go very far with. I have been a member of the church ever since I was baptized at the age of 8, and my favorite scripture comes from Jacob 6:12, “oh be wise, what can I say more?” I look forward to working and learning with all of you this semester!
