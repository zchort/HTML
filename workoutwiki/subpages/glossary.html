                <br>
                Body Mass Index (BMI) - Measure of the relationship between height and weight; calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in centimetres squared. The BMI gives an indication of total body fat content. A high BMI scores usually indicating higher levels of body fat. BMI is often used as a general population measure to determine the level of health risk associated with obesity. However, in certain populations BMI can be inaccurate as a measure of body fatness, for example large and muscular, though lean, athletes may score high BMI levels, which incorrectly rates them as obese.

                Detraining Principle - This is the 'use it or lose it' principle. If an individual stops exercising regularly they will eventually lose the strength and aerobic fitness they acquired: muscles will weaken in two weeks or less.
                DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) - Muscle soreness or discomfort that appears 12 to 48 hours after unaccustomed or strenuous exercise. The soreness is felt most strongly 24 to 72 hours after the exercise. It is most likely due to microscopic tears in the muscle tissue, and it usually takes a couple of days for the repair and rebuilding process to be complete. After the experience, the muscle adapts rapidly to prevent muscle damage, and thereby soreness, if the exercise is repeated.

                High-intensity interval training (HIIT) - is a form of training incorporating intense periods of anaerobic work with short recovery segments at a lower intensity. According to the ACSM "HIIT workouts provide similar fitness benefits as continuous endurance workouts, but in shorter periods of time. This is because HIIT workouts tend to burn more calories than traditional workouts, especially after the workout". Technogym's equipment like MyRun makes it easy for users to set their ideal interval training schedule. Interval duration and numbers of sessions can be set at a press of a button.

                Isokinetic exercise - Isokinetic exercises are where variable resistance is applied to a limb in constant motion. While performing isokinetic exercises, the individual contracts a muscle while quickly move the limb. Equipment such as stationary bikes -- for which you can establish a number of revolutions per minute -- and resistance bands can allow performance of isokinetic exercises, although specialised equipment is necessary in many cases. Isokinetic exercise is mainly for physiotherapy.

                Lifestyle activities - Includes physical actions you perform as part of daily living. Lifestyle activity is generally not planned and occurs as a consequence of working, traveling, raising children, etc. - just plain living! Some lifestyle activities are more strenuous than others and can contribute to sizeable energy expenditure. Examples include taking the stairs instead of using the elevator, walking to do errands instead of driving, getting off a bus one stop early, or parking farther away than usual to walk to a destination.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lactic acid - This used to be considered a waste substance that builds up in the muscles during aerobic activity that lead to muscle fatigue and soreness. However, experts now believe that lactic acid acts as a "fuel" to help people continue high-intensity (anaerobic) exercise even when oxygen consumption is low.
                <br>
                <br>
                Lactic threshold - Also known as the anaerobic threshold (see above).

                <br>
                Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - LDL cholesterol is considered the “bad” cholesterol because it contributes to plaque, a thick, hard deposit that can clog arteries and make them less flexible.
                <br>
                <br>
                Low impact - Activities that place less stress on the bones and joints. Not to be confused with easy or ineffective, low-impact exercise is a great option for challenging the whole body – without all the stress. Consequently, low impact activities are better for people with joint pain or overweight individuals whose weight can hurt their joints. Examples include: swimming and cycling.

                Maximum heart rate - The highest number of heart beats per minute (bpm) when exercising at an individual’s maximum intensity. The easiest and best-known method to calculate your maximum heart rate (HRmax) is to use the formula: HRmax = 220 - Age. MYRUN TECHNOGYM is compatible with all the Bluetooth Smart chest belts allowing individuals to effortlessly monitor their heart rate during workouts.
                <br>
                <br>
                Max VO 2 - V02 Max represents the maximum amount of oxygen that can be removed from circulating blood and used by the working tissues during a specified period. The higher this number, the greater the cardiovascular fitness and the ability to work at increased levels of intensity.

                <br>
                Metabolic Equivalents (MET)s - is a physiological measure expressing the energy it takes to complete physical activities. It is frequently used as a measure of intensity on cardiovascular machines (treadmills e.g., stationary bikes e.g., Group Cycle, etc.). Some types of physical activities are assigned MET values, with the higher the number meaning the more intense the activity.
                <br>
                <br>
                Moderate intensity - Activities that range from 40-60% of max heart rate.

                Overload Principle - This principle says that in order to keep making gains from an exercise program, you must find some way to make it more difficult. This is because bodies adapt to exercise. Once your body adapts to a given workload, it will not continue to adapt unless the workload is increased/made more difficult again.

                Physical activity - Any bodily movement that uses energy. Walking, gardening, briskly pushing a child’s pushchair, climbing the stairs, playing football, or dancing the night away, are all good examples of physical activity. To improve your physical wellbeing from physical activity it needs to be of a moderate or vigorous intensity (see Overload Principle).

                Physical fitness - The ability to perform every day tasks with vigour and alertness, and to also enjoy leisure pursuits without becoming unduly fatigued. Physical fitness includes a number of components consisting of cardiovascular endurance (aerobic power), muscle strength and endurance, muscle power, flexibility, balance, speed of movement, coordination and reaction time, and body composition.

                Progression - The process of increasing the intensity, duration, frequency, or amount of activity or exercise as the body adapts to ensure that it continues to make improvements as a result of the Overload Principle (see above). Technogym’s mywellness Cloud is a revolutionary new open platform that allows individuals to measure and aggregate all of the data surrounding their physical activities, both inside the gym and out, making it easy to see how to progress their workouts and keep improving their fitness.

                Plyometric training - A plyometric movement is a quick and eccentric (muscle lengthening) action immediately followed by a concentric (muscle shortening) action. Performing plyometric movements builds explosive power and can increase how high you can jump or how fast you move off from a static or relatively stationary position. Jumping down from a box with an immediate explosive vertical jump is an example of plyometric exercise.

                Range of motion (ROM) - This is a term commonly used to describe the extremities of the movement a joint can make.
                Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) - The RPE is a scale is used to measure the intensity of an individual's exercise by asking them to rate how they feel (both physically and mentally) in relation to exercise fatigue on a scale of 6-20 (original scale) or 0 -10 (modified scale). On the 0-10 scale 1 is least and 10 is most.

                <br>
                Repetition - The number of times an exercise is repeated within a single exercise “set.”

                <br>
                Resting HR - Rate at which your heart beats at rest (while sitting or being inactive). Low resting heart rates are generally a good measure of health and fitness.
                <br>
                <br>
                Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) - Number of calories expended to maintain the body during resting conditions. Also referred to as basal metabolic rate.

                Recovery - The time it takes to recuperate following a period of exercise. When you perform an exercise, you’ll eventually get to the point where you need time to rest or ease up. This is referred to as your “recovery” period, and can vary from several seconds up to several minutes depending on your level of fitness and the intensity/duration of the exercise performed.

                <p>
                Set - Repeating the same exercise a specific number of times. For example, if you did ten sit ups that would be one set of ten repetitions (reps). Sets are interspersed with a rest period. Hence you could do 3 sets of 10 reps.
                Slow twitch muscle fibres - The slow muscles are more efficient at using oxygen to generate more fuel for continuous, extended muscle contractions over a long time. They fire more slowly than fast twitch fibres and can keep going for longer before they fatigue. Therefore, slow twitch fibres are better for endurance sports like long distance running or cycling.

                Specificity of Training Principle - This principle says that only the muscle or muscle group you exercise will respond to the demands placed upon it. The principle of Specificity also implies that to become better at a particular exercise or skill, you must perform that exercise or skill.

                <br>
                Static stretching - Used to stretch the muscles while the body is at rest. To perform a static stretch the individual elongates the muscles to the point where they feel slight discomfort (not pain). They then hold that position for up to 30 seconds before releasing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Strength training (resistance training) - A type of physical exercise specialising in the use of resistance. For example, body weight, weight machines (Unica, Kinesis) or free weights to cause skeletal muscular contractions, which builds their strength, anaerobic endurance, and size.
