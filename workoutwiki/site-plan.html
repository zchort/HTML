      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The workout wiki is the place to come to if anyone ever needs to find information on how to start working out, and not only that, how to start working out quickly. It is by far the best website in teaching you how to target muscle groups, which muscle groups to target, how to formulate a workout, and how to calculate individual-specific stats in order to reach health goals tailored specifically to your own desires. 
        <br>                
        Overall, it will be more likely for people to come to my site because there are no, or very few, other sites which offer such an extensive organization of such information. It has a place in the demographics of both experienced health enthusiasts, bodybuilders, and people just starting their fitness journey, as it provides a gate way for those beginners to begin learning about fitness, working out, as well as having pre-made beginnner templates. For the experienced demographic, it provides a way to organize all of the information they already know about, instead of having their workout plans all on dinky excel sheets, their body stats in thrown-about notes on their notes app, and having to open twenty-five different tabs to calculate various oddities to get a scope of their goals. Instead of that, there will be one place on the internet, Workout Wiki, which organizes and takes care of all of this information smoothly, efficiently, and conveniently.      </p>

      <h3>Muscle Groups</h3>
      <p>
        People are going to be satisfied by a general percievable structure behind the website's design; that is not referring to how the site itself is built, but a structure in concepts that lay out a general foundation to work off of and further provide a way for the user to organize what they learn hierarchically. As a way to cater to this, this site is based very loosely on the Law of Three. It will split information structure about the muscle groups into three primary categories, upper, middle, and lower, and from there muscle groups gradually break down from broad muscle groups (such as a workout that covers many muscles) and eventually into singular-specific muscles, presenting them in a cone hierarchy which is comprehensive and easy to digest. For example, upper boddy has a specific area of exercises, and pushups would be towards the top of the hierarchy because it works out multiple large muscle groups. Moving down, biceps would be a singular-specific exercise. Further, there will be information tailored to the different body types - ectomorph, endomorph, and mesomorph - and what may be ideal or expectative results from workouts in these three body types.
        <br>
        There would also be a collection of calculators which can allow the user to calculate specific body stats, goals, and means of achieving those goals. If somebody wanted to know their specific calorie-deficit in order to start losing weight, they would put in their own weight in order to get stats specific to them. Then, it may be recommended that they do specific exercises, such as cardio or calisthenics rather than heavy weights, to avoid gaining mass. Ideally if I were to continue building the site, there would be a sort of profile function which stores all of these stats into variables and keeps them neatly organized and easily accessible for quick referencing, as well as automatic plugging into site features to bring calculations about workouts and workout plans.

      <h3>Glossary</h3>
      <p>
        As people will mostly be coming here because they may be new to working out or just want a place to better organize and manage their health life, they would have to be familiar with the general site vocabulary which is further taken from the broader workout culture's vocabulary in referring to specific concepts in health improvement. As such, there would need to be a glossary which is easy to navigate and jump around in, possibly with a search feature, in order to understand what is actually being talked about in the site. These words would have extensive explanations of them in order to enilghten the users as to what they are about, and so they can use the words flexibly on their own.
